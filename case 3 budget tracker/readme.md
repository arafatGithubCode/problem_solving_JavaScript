# Case 3: Budget Tracker

## Problem Statement:

You are tasked with creating a budget tracker for users to manage their income and expenses. Users should be able to log incomes and expenses, categorize them (e.g., rent, food, entertainment), and get a report on their total income, total expenses, and remaining balance. The system should also provide a summary of expenses by category.

## Requirements:

- Users should be able to add income and add expenses.
- Each transaction (income or expense) should have a category, a description, and an amount.
- Users should be able to view a summary of their income, expenses, and balance.
- Users should be able to see a breakdown of expenses by category.
- Allow users to filter transactions by category.

## Instructions:

1. Break down tasks: Identify the steps involved in adding, viewing, and summarizing transactions.

2. Build Functions:

- Create a function to log income.
- Create a function to log expenses with a category.
- Create a function to generate a report that shows total income, total expenses, and remaining balance.
- Create a function to categorize expenses and generate a report by category.
- Create a function to filter transactions by category.separately.

## Edge Cases:

- Handle cases where the user logs an invalid amount (e.g., negative or zero).
- Handle cases where a user adds an expense without categorizing it.
- What happens if the user has more expenses than income?
